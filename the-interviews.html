						<h1>The Interviews</h1>
						<p class="info">Who should be interviewed? Why do we interview?</p>
					</header>
					<p>Human Centered Design says that all problems are solvable. Those who face those problems everyday have the keys to those answers. We, as designers, are to learn from people. We should be open to creative possibilities and find what is most desirable, feasible, and viable for the people and organization.</p>

<!-- interview 1 -->
				<h3>Rob Clark:</h3>
					<p>In order to better understand the goals of the organization from the perspective of an employee, the Director of Communications was contacted. His name is Rob Clark. I was able to call him and have a conversation over the phone. We discussed the major goals of the website and the overall achievements of the organization.</p>
					<p>Most of his answers were pretty generic and I had a hard time getting him to be very specific. But, the most important thing I learned from the interview was that the website is aimed equally at both the homeless and those who would like to help. This will provide a challenge in the design to find a good balance. Unfortunately he could not give me any website users (specifically someone who had found the organization through the website and gone through the program).</p>



			<div class=interview>
				<span class="image right"><img src="images/image10.jpg" alt="image of hydroponics garden" /></span>
				<blockquote>The intended audience of the website is everyone from the homeless (getting applications) to volunteers/donators to information about the family stores. The goal of the website is to connect with all of the above people and get them the information they need.</blockquote>
				<blockquote>Everything the company does can be found in the video under the media tab. <green>(I asked for the names of the programs and he said that the company covers a wide range of services and the best place to find all of this information was through an informational video. Eventually I found this video and watched it. It was more of an advertisement than a truly informational video. This video is definitely not one that can be placed on the home page as a description like some websites do.)</green></blockquote>
				<blockquote>The website is currently being re-done “in house” and will be launched within the next week <green>(four weeks into the project the website was updated, for the purpose of this assignemnt I will be working off of the old version).</green> The original website was made by web.com</blockquote>
				<blockquote>The Hydroponics garden is worked by men in the program and volunteers. It is a garden that is more vertical than horizontal. Styrofoam “cups” are stacked up five high and food is grown there. The food is used on campus for meals. This garden was started a few years ago and is a favorite place on campus to sit and relax.</blockquote>
				<blockquote>The Troxel Family center is the name of the building for the women and family residential participants. The Emmanuel Program is the name for the mens’ residential program. This lasts about 12-14 months and its goal is to get people back on their feet.</blockquote>
				<blockquote>The residential program is for men, women, or families. It requires six months of education and job training. The next part of the program requires that the participant apply to work in one of the family stores or elsewhere on campus. Most participants leave the program with 3,500-5,000 dollars saved up.</blockquote>
				<blockquote>The preschool and after school kid programs are specifically for the families in the residential programs but also for anyone interested. At Christmas and Thanksgiving, food drives collect supplies and boxes are filled and distributed.</blockquote>

<!-- interview 2 -->
			<h3>Alice Middleton:</h4>
				<p>For the second interview I contacted someone who I knew had done various volunteer events through Lighthouse. Unfortunately I had to do this email over interview, but she gave good information. Her name is Alice Middleton and she has two children, one in college and one recently graduated.</p>
				<p>This interview showed me the importance of clarifying what Lighthouse does compared to the other organizations in the city. She has some issues with overlap and confusing which events where with which group.</p>
				<div class=interview>
					<span class="image right"><img src="images/image4.jpg" alt="image of alice middleton" /></span>
					<p>How often do you volunteer with Lighthouse Ministries?</p>
					<blockquote>At present once per month. I also like to volunteer once or twice during the holidays when able.</blockquote>
					<p>What type of volunteer opportunities have you participated in?</p>
					<blockquote>When our oldest was in high school we assisted with a beautification project of the grounds (his Eagle Scout Project); in previous years when I lead a children’s ministry at church we would collect food at the holidays and take the children for a tour of the ministry; food drives; holiday food programs; organization of Troxel House (i.e. clothing donations, food pantry)</blockquote>
					<p>How do you learn about the volunteer opportunities?</p>
					<blockquote>Initially, and often even now, through our church email, but we also receive mailings from Lighthouse, and have been connected with them through Parker Street Ministries and people we know who are involved in that particular ministry. <green>(It is good to know that they send out an email because to give volunteer options. But the fact that she relies more on the church is a problem)</green></blockquote>
					<p>Do you volunteer most often with your family, school, or church? Have you volunteered with all of these groups at Lighthouse?</p>
					<blockquote>Most often with my church, but yes, with all in various ways.</blockquote>
					<p>If you have any questions about the upcoming events at Lighthouse do you check the website or the Facebook page?</p>
					<blockquote>Website <green>(This is good to know, from my experience on the website I would have thought everyone relied on the facebook page.)</green></blockquote>
					<p>If you have or would donate money, would you do it through the website? If another way please describe.</p>
					<blockquote>By check via mail, or through church collection.</blockquote>
					<p>Have you ever shopped at one of the Lighthouse stores? Did you find the location of the store through the website?</p>
					<blockquote>I haven’t been inside the store, but am familiar with the store closest to Lighthouse Ministries as I am frequently in the area and drive past it. I am one who goes directly to a website, however, to get the address and directions to a location.</blockquote>
					<p>Have you met and created a personal relationship with anyone who has gone through the residential program?</p>
					<blockquote>Through the breakfasts I have gotten to know some of the women going through their residential program, as well as their children.</blockquote>
					<p>If you have had questions about what Lighthouse does have you been able to find them on the website? (For example if you were wondering how many nights a homeless person could stay the night without paying.)</p>
					<blockquote>We have usually called the organization with our questions, but I am one to use the organization’s website (search engine) to seek for answers to questions I may have.</blockquote>

<!-- interview 3 -->
				<h3>Steven Livesay:</h4>
					<p>For the third interview I contacted another person who I knew to tutor at the program. Steven Livesay used to take students from Lakeland Christian School when he went during the school year to help at the childrens’ program.</p>
					<p>Between this interview and the last interview I noticed that neither person gives money online. I don’t know if this is because of the poor design of the website or because this is a more “hands on” organization that currently asks for more volunteers than donations. From my knowledge of these two individuals I do not believe this is an age gap situation where they do not give online because they do not know how.</p>
					<div class=interview>
						<span class="image right"><img src="images/image8.png" alt="image of LCS students in the preschool" /></span>
						<p>How often do you volunteer with Lighthouse Ministries?</p>
						<blockquote>Every Wednesday for two hours to tutor children. In Summer, 3 mornings per week (2 hours each day) to tutor adults.</blockquote>
						<p>Approximately how many children are at the after school program?</p>
						<blockquote>Anywhere from three to twelve. <green>(This surprised me. I had thought there would be much more.)</green></blockquote>
						<p>How do you learn about the volunteer opportunities?</p>
						<blockquote>Through my church.</blockquote>
						<p>Do you volunteer most often with your family, school, or church? Have you volunteered with all of these groups at Lighthouse?</p>
						<blockquote>I volunteered through my church and then I went on my own. Usually two to three LCS students would accompany me.</blockquote>
						<p>If you have any questions about the upcoming events at Lighthouse do you check the website or the Facebook page?</p>
						<blockquote>No. <green>(Ok this response was just funny to me. Partially because I know him and that is exactly what he would have said if I had this conversation face to face with him. But also, I think this is how most people feel about some non-profits: they just want to know one thing they don’t want emails forever and they don’t want any extra information.)</green></blockquote>
						<p>If you are going to donate money, would you do it through the website? If another way please describe.</p>
						<blockquote>I would never donate through the website, but usually in response to mail outs. <green>(Again no donations through the website.)</green></blockquote>
