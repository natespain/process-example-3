						<h1>The Goals</h1>
						<p class="info">What are the goals? What do we want to achieve on this website?</p>
					</header>
					<h3>Overarching Goals</h3>
					<p>We start by filling sticky notes with any group of people that have an influence on or were influenced by our organization. Direct involvement is the first category, then we move to anyone peripherally associated, and finally to the fans, sceptics, and anyone else the organization needs on their side.</p>
					<p>Then we sort the sticky notes into categories. By finding similarities in the people groups, I am able to narrow down the overarching audiences and goals for Lighthouse.</p>

					<h3 class="section-divider">Specific Goals</h3>
					<p>By narrowing down to more specific user categories, the most important goals become more evident. These categories can be based on race, age, gender, financial status, or any other category that applies. For my project the most effective way to make categories is by financial status, group size, and gender.</p>

					<p>Each user group is then given a list of goals and the content that provides a solution for those goals. Content that repeats across multiple categories proves itself to be the most beneficial to the website, thus making it a primary Call to Action, or CTA.</p>
