					</header>
					<h3>What is the problem you're trying to solve?</h3>
					<p>Help the homeless and really poor in Lakeland.</p>
					<h3>Take a stab at framing it as a design question.</h3>
					<p>How can Lighthouse Ministries tell the homeless of their aid?</p>
					<h3>Now state the ultimate impact you're trying to have.</h3>
					<p>Let the homeless know of the housing and education options at Lighthouse Ministries.</p>
					<h3>What are some possible solutions to your problem? Think broadly. It's fine to start a project with a hunch or two, but make sure you allow for surprising outcomes.</h3>
					<p>It needs to have a clear goal and volunteer opportunities on the home page. It needs to give specific options clearly. It should outline the programs they offer. A new color scheme should be chosen.</p>
					<h3>Finally, write down some of the context and constraints that you're facing. They could be geographic, technological, time-based, or have to do with the population you're trying to reach.</h3>
					<p>This is not in Anderson, that could be an issue. There is a very broad range of assistance. There are two main audiences: need help and give help.</p>
					<h3>Does you original questions need a tweak? Try it again.</h3>
					<p>How can the Lighthouse Ministries website clearly show the variety of help it offers while recieving two streams of viewers: those who want to give and those who need to get.</p>
