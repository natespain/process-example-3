					<h3>Style Tile</h3>
					<p class="adj">By compiling all of the information collected so far, the design part of the project can now begin. The first step is to come up with adjectives that describe the website and the company. The list of adjectives for Lighthouse includes: <center>reliable, respectful, helpful, ambitious, firm, long lasting, friendly, healthy, healing, personal, successful, encouraging, homey, and optimistic.</center></p>
					<p>Based on the adjectives, further decisions are made on the logo, patterns/textures, colors, typefaces, buttons, and layout. These are compiled into a Style Tile. After receiving feedback in class, edits were made to the Style Tile.</p>
					<div class="12u$"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/image45.jpg" alt="Style Tile Form" /></span></div>
					<h3>Call to Action</h3>
					<p>The Call to Action is the button that drives the user to complete a desired action. This should be visually striking and action oriented. The less words, the better. The location should be easy and logical while the contrast is large enough to draw attention. The copy should be clear and understandable.</p>
					<p>My organization has two main audiences, the homeless and those who are willing to help. Even within each audience, there are multiple CTAs becaue of the large range of help that Lighthouse offers.</p>
					<p>On the homepage, the top right corner will have two buttons that say <strong>Recieve Aid</strong> and <strong>Contribute.</strong> <strong>Recieve Aid</strong> will take the user to a new page where the user must determine how much aid he or she desires (application to the male or female residential program, one night, or food). The <strong>Contribute</strong> button will take users to a page to determine whether they chose to give money, food, or volunteer.</p>
					<p>The home page will also have a scrolling banner. This is not the primary CTA. This will be more evident on the actual website than in this example, becasue the blue color will be carried throughout the whole page, making the orange stand out more.</p>
					<p>The Call to Action I turned in during class was updated after receiving feedback. The entire layout of the button is now changed as well as the copy that described the action and what followed pressing the button. The previous design was too commital for the application, so the information required to proceed was removed. Also, the original button just had an arrow in place of copy. The new buttons are more descriptive of what page the user will be led to.</p>
